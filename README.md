# code_for_fun_graph_lesson
A custom challenge I created for my students.

In this challege, students must create a XY graph. Then once the graph is done, they have four challenges to complete.

1) Create a red circle in the middle of the top right section.
2) Create a blue circle in the middle of the bottom right section.
3) Create a yellow triangle in the bottom left section.
4) Create a green square in the top left position.


By the end of this challenge, the graph should look like this:
